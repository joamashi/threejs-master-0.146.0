# Empire State Building

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/eBYVQG](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/eBYVQG).

Made out of CSS rectangular prisms. Used background patterns and inset box shadows for the windows. There are probably some minor differences between this model and the actual thing in NYC since I referred to pictures of varying models.

Update 3/11/21: Replaced some obsolete Sass operations, my apologies if the color isn’t the same as before
